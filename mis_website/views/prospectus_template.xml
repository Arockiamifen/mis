                            Eugene de Mazenod was born into a noble family of Aix-en-Provence
                            in southern France in 1782, but his family had to flee as refugees
                            during the French Revolution. In 1802 he returned to France and embraced a
                            frivolous social life. However, on Good Friday 1807, before the crucifix in a
                            church in Aix, the young man experienced a profound conversion that made him
                            understand the spiritual and material plight of France and the Church. Within a year he entered the seminary and was ordained in 1811.

                            Father de Mazenod set about rebuilding a world of Christian values. He preached
                            in villages with passion, tirelessly bringing the Word of God and the sacraments
                            to all, visiting prisoners and offering the poor a renewed sense of dignity. In 1816
                            other priests, inspired by his vision and energy, joined him and in 1826 the Missionary
                            Oblates of Mary Immaculate was formally approved by Pope Leo XII. De Mazenod, deemed to
                            have had a heart as big as the world', sent his growing corps of Oblates to mission in Canada,
                            Sri Lanka, South Africa and in various parts of Europe.
